article: I am Sangita Rajendra Deshmukh based out of Dhamangaon Deviche village
  of Pathardi Block Ahmednagar dist. I have my small business of Grocery Shop
  and flour mill. Because of financial crunch in family, I was force to close my
  shop. During that period Uma madam (SELF staff) came in village and gave us
  the information about SELF providing loan assistance to women for
  self-employment and business purpose. Other women from our area, who were
  already aware about the JLG concept motivated me and asked to attend all the
  meetings. We also had a round of training where entrepreneurship skills were
  imparted to us and guided us to earn our livelihood from non-farm activity. I
  took first loan from Sampada of Rs. 20,000/- on June 2018. I invested in my
  grocery shop and reopened it. I was always committed for timely repayment and
  keeping the same in view, SELF gave me the second loan of Rs.30000/- on June
  2019 and subsequent loan 40000/-in Sept 2020. This loan amount was always
  invested in purchasing the raw material for the shop. SELF was not only
  instrumental in helping me restart the loan but also assisted me in expanding
  the business and learning concept of entrepreneurship that helped me to lead
  the business successfully. In this way I can start my business again and
  achieved my success. Will always be thankful to SELF.
