article: "Every year on year, working with Sampada Trust (parent organization of SELF) and SELF there on gives me a feeling of moving closer towards our mission of transforming lives by enabling financial inclusion and support through practicing innovation and excellence. I am working with SELF since its inception. I feel that the organization is more of a family for me now. In these past 7 years, me and SELF has seen the ups and downs together, from the time of having limited resources both at the institutional and personal level to finally taking concrete steps towards the achieving the goals of the organization along with my personal growth. Today I feel very happy every member of the family plays an essential role in this constant endeavor. 
SELF believe in celebrating every achievement and acknowledges the collective contribution of its employees, which motivates us and keep our goals well within the sight."
