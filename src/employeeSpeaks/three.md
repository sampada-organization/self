article:  "In the year 2011 SHG’s movement was on its peak, MAVIM was actively doing awareness and promotion of SHG program. I also become a member of Self-Help Group and I got a chance to work with MAVIM. During that period various organizations were also actively working with Self Help Group and Sampada Trust was one of them. Due to my active participation in SHG various SHG’s meetings started at my house, and then I eventually became a member of Sampada’s SHG. I still remember taking a loan of Rs.5000 from Sampada Trust and repaid regularly. When the opportunity came to be a part of SELF (A sister concern of Sampada Trust) in the year 2013 I accepted the same with wide arms. I joined as a trainee officer in SELF and risen the ranks to be one of the most senior credit officers. SELF had given me an opportunity to enhance my knowledge and skill and a platform to grow both personally and professionally. True to its core values SELF has stood by me during the lowest point of my life and lost my Husband in the year 2017. Even after my absence from work for considerable long period SELF has provided me with the care and understanding to overcome my grief and re-join my service. I feel proud be a part of SELF, which not only declare to be a safe and fair organization but also walks the talk in real life. I wish my company all success in its growth and hopes I will be a part of it in future too."
